    "\n",
    "### What is NLP? \n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is an area of computer science that focuses on developing techniques to produce machine-driven analyses of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Natural Language Processing Important? \n",
    "\n",
    "NLP expands the sheer amount of data that can be used for insight. Since so much of the data we have available is in the form of text, this is extremely important to data science!\n",
    "\n",
    "A specific common application of NLP is each time you use a language conversion tool. The techniques used to accurately convert text from one language to another very much falls under the umbrella of \"natural language processing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is NLP a \"hard\" problem? \n",
    "\n",
    "Language is inherently ambiguous. Once person's interpretation of a sentence may very well differ from another person's interpretation. Because of this inability to consistently be clear, it's hard to have an NLP technique that works perfectly. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Glossary\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some common terminology that we'll encounter throughout the workshop:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Corpus: </b> (Plural: Corpora) a collection of written texts that serve as our datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>nltk: </b> (Natural Language Toolkit) the python module we'll be using repeatedly; it has a lot of useful built-in NLP techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Token: </b> a string of contiguous characters between two spaces, or between a space and punctuation marks. A token can also be an integer, real, or a number with a colon."

    "Well, sentiment analysis involves building a system to collect and determine the emotional tone behind words. This is important because it allows you to gain an understanding of the attitudes, opinions and emotions of the people in your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, sentiment analysis involves Natural language processing and artificial intelligence by taking the actual text element, transforming it into a format that a machine can read, and using statistics to determine the actual sentiment.\n",

    "\n",
    "To accomplish sentiment analysis computationally, we have to use techniques that will allow us to learn from data that's already been labeled. \n",
